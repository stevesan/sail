GOAL: Pleasant aesthetic experience, ~30 min. Favor ease over realism, but still have enough physics for a sense of danger in high-winds.

TODO:

- integrate boat geo
- start making it SOUND good
    water splash
        should have the up/down motion of the boat correspond with wooshes and slaps
    wind effects
- put interesting geometry around the corner..
    need to get better at...3d modeling? or just create a better voxel editor?
    would be nice to have heightmap->voxel exporter. then an editor to add things like canyons, etc.

- behind boat wake effects
- have terrain morph on special events??
- two mountains part to reveal a new path...yes!
    would be cooler if they were deformed, rather than just two models moving.
    like two Gaussian's moving apart..formally a tall mountain..heh
- really would like better rope physics. like Brothers
- have a light metero shower, with meteors hitting the water
- thunder storm

- create visual for checkpoints. should be sizeable, like teleports rings in Ecco

- progression:
    start in narrow dock, perp to wind.
    then S-shaped narrows, to get used to ruddering
    then sharper U turn, for a tack
    skill progression:
        all-out down wind
        rudder turning
        checkpoint loading
        actual turning


TABLED:
- centerboard control
- docks
- i think controlling wind should be an advanced unlock or something..
- day night cycle for higher winds when it's night?

DONE:
- visual feedback for main sheet
- rudder for pushing against shore
- aim particles for pushing off. maybe a world-space handprint
- new low poly water:
    can't have grid just following the player around... just make giant grid? 
    hm ok, ran into unity's 65k vert limit again.. ok, let's see how it looks with 100x100 grid res, and worry about chunking if necessary.
- water: need to get basic lighting working in shader...
- checkpoints
- save lake state (ie. waves origin)
- water gfx: rotate normals
    this actually doesn't look great. I did an effect that changes alpha depending on viewing angle and it's quite cool
- speed particles
