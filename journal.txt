TODO:

- make all checkpoints/stars float and bob like buoys, with an anchor so they don't drift far
- progression:
    start in narrow dock, perp to wind.
    then S-shaped narrows, to get used to ruddering
    then sharper U turn, for a tack

    skill progression:
        rudder

- water gfx: rotate normals
- speed particles
- splash sounds?
    should have the up/down motion of the boat correspond with wooshes and slaps

TABLED:
- centerboard control
- docks
- i think controlling wind should be an advanced unlock or something..
- day night cycle for higher winds when it's night?

DONE:
- visual feedback for main sheet
- rudder for pushing against shore
- aim particles for pushing off. maybe a world-space handprint
- new low poly water:
    can't have grid just following the player around... just make giant grid? 
    hm ok, ran into unity's 65k vert limit again.. ok, let's see how it looks with 100x100 grid res, and worry about chunking if necessary.
- water: need to get basic lighting working in shader...
- checkpoints
- save lake state (ie. waves origin)
