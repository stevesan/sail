TODO:

- speed particles
- splash sounds?
- progression:
    start in narrow dock, perp to wind.
    then S-shaped narrows, to get used to ruddering
    then sharper U turn, for a tack
    check points

TABLED:
- centerboard control
- docks
- i think controlling wind should be an advanced unlock or something..
- day night cycle for higher winds when it's night?

DONE:
- visual feedback for main sheet
- rudder for pushing against shore
- aim particles for pushing off. maybe a world-space handprint
